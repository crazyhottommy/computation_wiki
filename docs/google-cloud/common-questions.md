#### Q1. How to update conda environment under /home/taing/miniconda?

You can become any other user on GCP by typing:

```

For example you can become  user `taing` and edit the conda environment like this:

1. switch user

```bash
sudo -su taing
```
2. Source taing's miniconda environment

make the following `taing_env.bash`

```bash
touch taing_env.bash
nano taing_env.bash

```

Copy the following lines in taing_env.bash

```bash
export CONDA_ROOT=/home/taing/miniconda3
export CONDA_ENVS_PATH=$CONDA_ROOT/envs
export PATH=/home/taing/miniconda3/bin:$PATH
unset PYTHONPATH
export HOME=/home/taing
```


```bash
source taing_env.bash
```
